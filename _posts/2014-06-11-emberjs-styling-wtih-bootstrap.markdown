Every time I work with EmberJS and start putting together the base structure of the application, I always start looking for guides and tutorials to add a basic styling for it.

I decided to start with Twitter Bootstrap, the most common styling framework out there; however there are many ways to achieve this, and I don't want to write a book about this, so let's follow three different routes to achieve this.

## Setup the base application

## Using a CDN

## Using bower with simple CSS

## Using bower with SASS
